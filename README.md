# Bike Shop Management API

A **Bike Shop Management API** built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB** using **Mongoose** for schema validation and data operations. This API allows users to manage bike inventory and order bikes.

## Features

-   **Bike Management:**
    -   Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) bikes in the inventory.
    -   Validate bike details using Mongoose schemas.
-   **Order Management:**

    -   Place orders for bikes.
    -   Calculate total revenue from all orders using MongoDB aggregation.

-   **TypeScript Integration:**
    -   Strongly typed code for improved development experience and error detection.

## Technologies Used

-   **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
-   **Express.js**: Web application framework.
-   **TypeScript**: Type-safe programming language.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
-   **Mongoose**: MongoDB ODM for schema validation and data operations.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krHasan/ph-L2-M2-B4-assignment.git
    cd ph-L2-M2-B4-assignment

    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a .env file and configure your MongoDB connection string:

    ```bash
    PORT=5000
    DATABASE_URL=<replace with your mongoDB connection string>
    ```

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```

5. Access the API at http://localhost:5000.
